# Oympi

Oympi is a **decentralized, physical messaging system** where messages travel **without the need for the Internet or centralized servers**. Messages are not stored permanently but must be **physically transported** by users from one machine to another. This ensures **privacy, security, and resilience** in areas with no connectivity.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User A writes a message** on an available computer. The message is stored locally but cannot be sent directly.
2. **User B arrives** at the same machine, adds a new message, but **must also take the existing messages** to move them elsewhere.
3. **User B moves to another computer** and **drops off the messages**. They can check if any messages are addressed to them.
4. The process **continues**, allowing messages to be physically carried across different locations.
5. **User C**, waiting for a message from A, **connects to a random machine** and finds their message if it has passed through that location.

## 🔥 Key Features

✅ **No Internet Required** – Messages move **offline** through users.  
✅ **Anonymous & Secure** – Messages are **end-to-end encrypted** and leave **no centralized trace**.  
✅ **Physical Propagation** – Messages are **not stored permanently**; they **must be carried** to survive.  
✅ **Peer-to-Peer Exchange** – Users **must relay messages** to participate, ensuring continuous movement.  
✅ **No Fixed Identity** – No user accounts, just **public/private key pairs** for message retrieval.  

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Install & Run** Oympi on any computer.  
2. **Check for messages** – If messages exist, pick them up or leave your own.  
3. **Travel & Connect** to another computer with Oympi.  
4. **Drop messages** and check if you received any intended for you.  
5. **Repeat the process** – The network grows as messages move!  

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **End-to-end encryption** – Only the recipient can read the message.  
- **No tracking** – Messages **do not leave metadata** or identifiable footprints.  
- **Temporary storage** – Messages disappear once delivered.  

## 🌍 Use Cases

- **Communication in areas without Internet** (natural disasters, rural locations).  
- **Censorship-resistant messaging** (anonymous and offline).  
- **Experimental social networking** (observe how messages travel).  
- **Secure information exchange** (hackerspaces, universities, field operations).  

## 📌 Technical Overview

- **Programming Language**: Rust / Python (TBD)  
- **Encryption**: AES-256 + RSA public/private key encryption  
- **Storage**: Local temporary folder (auto-cleaned after delivery)  
- **Transport Methods**: USB, local network shares, manual file movement  

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- ✅ Automatic relay between machines on the same **local network**.  
- ✅ QR-code based message transport for **mobile devices**.  
- ✅ Configurable **message expiration & deletion policies**.
